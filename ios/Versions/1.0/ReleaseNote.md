## Description

Mafia (also known as Werewolf, Assassin, Witch Hunt, Palermo Nights or Pirates) is a party game created in the USSR by Dimitry Davidoff in 1986, modelling a battle between an informed minority (the mafia) and an uninformed majority (the townspeople). Mafia was called one of the 50 most historically and culturally significant games published since 1800 by about.com.

Mafia Assistant implements the basic Mafia gameplay, as well as some common variations (assassin, guardian, traitor, undercover, etc.). It also includes a new two-handed mode allowing one player to play two roles.

This application could be used to help the Judge (the Game Narrator) moderate the game.
