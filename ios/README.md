# Mafia for iPhone


## Building

Install and setup [CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/), if it's not done yet:

    $ sudo gem update --system    # Make sure a recent RubyGems is installed
    $ sudo gem install cocoapods  # Install CocoaPods
    $ pod setup                   # Clone the CocoaPods Specs repository into ~/.cocoapods/

Install project dependencies:

    $ cd ios/
    $ pod install

Open `Mafia.xcworkspace` (generated by CocoaPods) in XCode and build the project.


## TODO

- Migrate storyboards to auto layout.
- Replace MBProgressHUD by SVProgressHUD.
- Remove dependency on TSMessages.
